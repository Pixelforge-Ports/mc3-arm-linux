# Build the rough on-device test package for Modern Combat 3.
#
# This is NOT the release packager. It produces build/mc3-test.zip, a
# PortMaster autoinstall zip carrying the loader, the libraries the CFW will not
# have, the launcher and the gptk - and nothing of the game's. The player's own
# files are laid out by hand into ports/mc3/ afterwards:
#
#   ports/mc3/lib/armeabi-v7a/libModernCombat3.so
#   ports/mc3/main.1120.com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftM3HM.obb
#   ports/mc3/patch.11428.com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftM3HM.obb
#
# A released port imports those with eapx instead; that is deliberately absent
# here, and so is the artwork. What is NOT optional is the launcher's
# missing-files screen, because "no game data" has to be a message and not a
# black panel.
#
# Usage (from the port root):
#     ./package_test.sh            build, collect libs, gate glibc, zip
#     ./package_test.sh --no-build use the binary already in build/
set -euo pipefail

Put your own copy of Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation (build 1.1.7g) in this
directory. The port never ships Gameloft's files.

Required layout, relative to this file:

  lib/armeabi-v7a/libModernCombat3.so
  main.1120.com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftM3HM.obb
  patch.11428.com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftM3HM.obb

The .so must be the 1.1.7g build; the loader patches fixed offsets in it and
the launcher checks its sha1 before starting the game.

Nothing here imports an APK yet - extract it on a computer.
